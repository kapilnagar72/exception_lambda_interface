1. Explain different types of Errors in java.
 Ans :   Runtime Error
        Compile Time Error

2. What is an Exception in java .
 Ans : Formally, an exception in Java is “an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.”
   There are many typical causes for exceptions in Java, including: Loss of network connectivity. Invalid input data. Requests for missing or non-existent files.

3. How can you handle exceptions in java?Explain with an example .
 Ans : The Exception Handling in Java is one of the powerful mechanism to handle the runtime errors so that the normal flow of the application can be maintained.
   In this tutorial, we will learn about Java exceptions, it's types, and the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions.

4. Why do we need exception handling in java?
 Ans : Exception handling is the process of responding to unwanted or unexpected events when a computer program runs.
    Exception handling deals with these events to avoid the program or system crashing, and without this process, exceptions would disrupt the normal operation of a program.

5. What is the difference between exception and error in java?
 Ans : Both exceptions and errors are the subclasses of a throwable class. The error implies a problem that mostly arises due to the shortage of system resources.
 On the other hand, the exceptions occur during runtime and compile time.
   
6. Name the different types of exceptions in Java.
 Ans : Built-in exceptions are the exceptions that are available in Java libraries. These exceptions are suitable to explain certain error situations.
 Below is the list of important built-in exceptions in Java. 

ArithmeticException: It is thrown when an exceptional condition has occurred in an arithmetic operation.
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: It is thrown to indicate that an array has been accessed with an illegal index. 
The index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.

ClassNotFoundException: This Exception is raised when we try to access a class whose definition is not found

FileNotFoundException: This Exception is raised when a file is not accessible or does not open.

IOException: It is thrown when an input-output operation failed or interrupted

InterruptedException: It is thrown when a thread is waiting, sleeping, or doing some processing, and it is interrupted.

NoSuchFieldException: It is thrown when a class does not contain the field (or variable) specified

NoSuchMethodException: It is thrown when accessing a method that is not found.

NullPointerException: This exception is raised when referring to the members of a null object. Null represents nothing

NumberFormatException: This exception is raised when a method could not convert a string into a numeric format.

RuntimeException: This represents an exception that occurs during runtime.

StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: It is thrown by String class methods to indicate that an index is either negative or greater than the size of the string

IllegalArgumentException : This exception will throw the error or error statement when the method receives an argument which is not accurately fit to the given relation or condition. It comes under the unchecked exception. 

IllegalStateException : This exception will throw an error or error message when the method is not accessed for the particular operation in the application. It comes under the unchecked exception.
